    "Mean and variance are probably the most common properties of random variables. A big chunk of theoretical results take advantage of the immediate as well as lesser known properties of these two quantities. Nevertheless, relying completely on these two concepts or their generalized form of statistical moments is unsafe, as there are families of random variables that don't have a variance or mean. Well known examples are the [Student T Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) or the [Cauchy Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution).  \n",

    "Keep in mind that these formulas aim to **estimate** the true population mean and variance. This begs two important caveats:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Another estimator might be 'better' in some sense of goodness.** A famous example where the standard mean-estimator underperforms is Stein's paradoxon - some information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%E2%80%93Stein_estimator). \n",
    "2. **Mean and variance of the underlying distribution might not even exist.** Even more dangerous - since our sample will always have finite mean and variance, we will never know if the underlying distribution has finite equivalents. If the distribution actually has an existing mean but not variance, the estimator of the mean would also be bogus, as the variance of the above estimator of the mean [depends on the population variance as well](https://www.stat.washington.edu/people/fanghan/teaching/STAT583/quantile.pdf)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we can get away with ignoring these difficulties. In fact, a whole lot of standard Machine Learning theory depends on the existence of mean and variance and the field still unarguably yields exciting results. Nevertheless, I recommend some caution here as there is no general guarantee that a real-world problem doesn't behave in a highly nasty way. The distribution of stock-market returns might be a real-world example of non-existent variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this begs the question of how to mitigate this problem. One option would be to consider stronger emphasis on quantiles whose main sample-based estimator at least [does not depend on statistical moments](https://www.stat.washington.edu/people/fanghan/teaching/STAT583/quantile.pdf). We will get to quantiles later on."
